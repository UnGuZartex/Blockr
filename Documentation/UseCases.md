1d. When the user presses the mouse key and the block is connected to other blocks
  1. The system disconnects the block on it's socket.
  2. The system system drags all blocks which are connected through the socket as one entity.
  3. The system sees all the blocks as one entity.
  
1e. When the user releases the mouse key, the socket of the block is near the plug of another block.
 1. The system connects the socket of the moving block with the plug of the other block.
 
  
## Use Case 3: Delete Program Block
### Precondition
There is a block in the Program Area.
### Success Guarantee (Postcondition)
The user is aware that the block is deleted. The block gets deleted from the Program Area. The amount of blocks to be placed is updated.
### Main Success Scenario
1. The user moves the mouse cursor over a block in the Program Area, then presses the left mouse key. 
 The user then moves the mouse cursor to the Palette, and then releases the left mouse key.
 2. The system deletes the block from the Program Area.

 2. The system system drags all blocks which are connected through the socket as one entity.
 3. The system sees all the blocks as one entity.
 
2a. When the maximum amount of blocks was inside the Program Area

 2. The system adds back all possible blocks to the Palette.



## Use Case 4: Start Program Step
### Precondition

1. The system ignores the second call from the user.

2a. When multiple sets of connected blocks are present in the Program Area
1. The system gives an error message telling that all blocks in the Program Area should be connected.
2. The system doesn't evaluate any set of blocks.

3a. When the execution of the program has already started
1. The system unhighlights the block which has been executed last.
2. The system executes the block which is connected to the plug of the last block which has been executed.
