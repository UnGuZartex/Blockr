### Extensions
1a. When the user releases the mouse key, one of the block’s 
connectors is near a compatible opposite connector of another block.
 1. The system adds a new block of the same type to the ProgramArea;
 the new block is inserted into an existing group of connected blocks at the matching connection point.

1b. When the user releases the mouse key outside of the Program Area
 1. No block is added to the Program Area

1c. When the user hasn't moved over a block in the Palette
 1. No action occurs

1d. When the user presses another key than the left mouse button
 1. No action considering adding occurs.

4a. When the maximum amount of blocks in the Program Area has been reached.
 1. The system removes all blocks from the Palette.
 
## Use Case 2: Moving Program Block

### Success Guarantee (Postcondition)
The user is aware of the new position of the block. The position of the block gets updated to the new position.
### Main Success Scenario
 1. The user moves the mouse cursor over a block in the Program Area, then presses the left mouse key. 
 The user then moves the mouse cursor inside the Program Area, and then releases the left mouse key.
 2. The system changes the position of the block from the previous position to the mouse position.
### Extensions
1a. When the user releases the mouse cursor outside the Program Area and Palette
1. The system doesn't change the block's position.

1b. When the user hasn't moved over a block in the Program Area
 1. No action occurs
 
1c. When the user presses another key than the left mouse button
 1. No action considering moving occurs.

1d. When the user presses the mouse key and the block is connected to other blocks
 1. The system disconnects the block and all underlying blocks from the blocks above
 2. The system moves the block and all underlying blocks to the new position

1e. When the user releases the mouse key, one of the block’s 
connectors is near a compatible opposite connector of another block.
 1. The block is inserted into an existing group of connected blocks at the matching connection point.
 
## Use Case 3: Delete Program Block
### Precondition
There is a block in the Program Area
### Success Guarantee (Postcondition)
The user is aware that the block is deleted. The block gets deleted from the list of blocks in the Program Area. The amount of blocks to be placed is updated.
### Main Success Scenario
1. The user moves the mouse cursor over a block in the Program Area, then presses the left mouse key. 
 The user then moves the mouse cursor to the Palette, and then releases the left mouse key.
 2. The system deletes the block from the Program Area.
 
### Extensions
1a. When the user hasn't moved over a block in the Program Area
 1. No action occurs
 
1b. When the user presses another key than the left mouse button
 1. No action considering deleting occurs
 
1c. When the user releases the mouse cursor outside the Program Area and Palette
 1. No action occurs
 
1d. When the user presses the mouse key and the block is connected to other blocks
 1. The system disconnects the block and all underlying blocks from the blocks above
 2. The system deletes the block and all underlying blocks.
 
2a. When the maximum amount of blocks was inside the Program Area
 1. The system deletes the block from the Program Area
 2. The system adds back all possible blocks to the Palette



## Use Case 4: Execute Program Step
### Precondition
The application itself is fully loaded in
### Success Guarantee (Postcondition)
The user is aware that a step of the program is executed. The Game World gets updated with the commands following the step. 
### Main Success Scenario

1. The user presses F5.
2. The system identifies the program in the Program Area.
3. The system evaluates the first block and highlights it.
4. The system changes the state of the robot in the Game World accordingly to the block.  

### Extensions

1a. When the system is already busy executing a step in the program
1. The system ignores the second call from the user.

2a. When multiple sets of connected blocks are present in the Program Area
1. The system doesn't evaluate any set of blocks.

3a. When some block has already been executed in the program
1. The system unhiglights this block.
2. The system executes the next block and hightlights this. 

3b. When the block to execute is a loop block
1. The system highlights the loop block.
2. The system evaluates the loop condition. 
3. The system determines the block to go to for the next iteration. 

3c. When the block to execute is contained in a loop block
1. The system highlights the loop block in which the block to execute is contained. 

4a. When the the block doesn't affect the robot's state
