  * True: when a Wall is in front of the robot.
  * False: when no Wall is in front of the robot.
* Not-condition: Inverts the logic value of the blocks next to it.
  * False: when block next to it is true.
  * True: when block next to it is false.
* While-block
* If-block
* MoveForward-block
* TurnLeft-block
